## Q. What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome\'s V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.

## Q. What is Node.js Process Model?

Node.js runs in a single process and the application code runs in a single thread and thereby needs less resources than other platforms.

All the user requests to your web application will be handled by a single thread and all the I/O work or long running job is performed asynchronously for a particular request. So, this single thread doesn\'t have to wait for the request to complete and is free to handle the next request. When asynchronous I/O work completes then it processes the request further and sends the response.

## Q. What are the key features of Node.js?

* **Asynchronous and Event driven** – All APIs of Node.js are asynchronous. This feature means that if a Node receives a request for some Input/Output operation, it will execute that operation in the background and continue with the processing of other requests. Thus it will not wait for the response from the previous requests.

* **Fast in Code execution** – Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one which is used by Google Chrome. Node has a wrapper over the JavaScript engine which makes the runtime engine much faster and hence processing of requests within Node.js also become faster.

* **Single Threaded but Highly Scalable** – Node.js uses a single thread model for event looping. The response from these events may or may not reach the server immediately. However, this does not block other operations. Thus making Node.js highly scalable. Traditional servers create limited threads to handle requests while Node.js creates a single thread that provides service to much larger numbers of such requests.

* **Node.js library uses JavaScript** – This is another important aspect of Node.js from the developer\'s point of view. The majority of developers are already well-versed in JavaScript. Hence, development in Node.js becomes easier for a developer who knows JavaScript.

* **There is an Active and vibrant community for the Node.js framework** – The active community always keeps the framework updated with the latest trends in the web development.

* **No Buffering** – Node.js applications never buffer any data. They simply output the data in chunks.

## Q. How does Node.js work?

A Node.js application creates a single thread on its invocation. Whenever Node.js receives a request, it first completes its processing before moving on to the next request.

Node.js works asynchronously by using the event loop and callback functions, to handle multiple requests coming in parallel. An Event Loop is a functionality which handles and processes all your external events and just converts them to a callback function. It invokes all the event handlers at a proper time. Thus, lots of work is done on the back-end, while processing a single request, so that the new incoming request doesn\'t have to wait if the processing is not complete.

While processing a request, Node.js attaches a callback function to it and moves it to the back-end. Now, whenever its response is ready, an event is called which triggers the associated callback function to send this response.

## Q. What is difference between process and threads in Node.js?

**1. Process:**

Processes are basically the programs that are dispatched from the ready state and are scheduled in the CPU for execution. PCB (Process Control Block) holds the concept of process. A process can create other processes which are known as Child Processes. The process takes more time to terminate and it is isolated means it does not share the memory with any other process.

The process can have the following states new, ready, running, waiting, terminated, and suspended.

**2. Thread:**

Thread is the segment of a process which means a process can have multiple threads and these multiple threads are contained within a process. A thread has three states: Running, Ready, and Blocked.

The thread takes less time to terminate as compared to the process but unlike the process, threads do not isolate.

## # 2. NODE.JS SETUP

<br/>

## Q. How to create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World?

**Step 01**: Create a project directory

```js
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
```

**Step 02**: Initialize project and link it to npm

```js
npm init
```

This creates a `package.json` file in your myapp folder. The file contains references for all npm packages you have downloaded to your project. The command will prompt you to enter a number of things.
You can enter your way through all of them EXCEPT this one:

```js
entry point: (index.js)
```

Rename this to:

```js
app.js
```

**Step 03**: Install Express in the myapp directory

```js
npm install express --save
```

**Step 04**: app.js

```js
/**
 * Express.js
 */
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('App listening on port 3000!');
});
```

**Step 05**: Run the app

```bah
node app.js
```
