## Global Objects

In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope.
That means that in browsers if you're in the global scope var something will define a global variable.
In Node this is different. The top-level scope is not the global scope; var something inside a Node module will be local to that module.

|  API        |  Description |
|-------------|--------------|
|__filename;  | The filename of the code being executed. (absolute path)|
|__dirname;   | The name of the directory that the currently executing script resides in. (absolute path)|
|module;      | A reference to the current module. In particular module.exports is used for defining what a module exports and makes available through require().
|exports;     | A reference to the module.exports that is shorter to type.|
|process;     | The process object is a global object and can be accessed from anywhere. It is an instance of EventEmitter.|

## Modules

```javascript
var module = require('./module.js');    // Loads the module module.js in the same directory.
module.require('./another_module.js');  // load another_module as if require() was called from the module itself.
```

    area: function() {
      return width * width;
    }
  };
}
```

## Util

These functions are in the module 'util'. Use require('util') to access them.

|  API                        |  Description                         |

## Events

All objects which emit events are instances of events.EventEmitter. You can access this module by doing: require("events");
To access the EventEmitter class, require('events').EventEmitter.
All EventEmitters emit the event 'newListener' when new listeners are added and 'removeListener' when a listener is removed.

|  API                                  |  Description                         |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|emitter.addListener(event, listener);  |Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.|
|emitter.on(event, listener);           |Same as emitter.addListener().|
|emitter.once(event, listener);         |Adds a one time listener for the event. This listener is invoked only the next time the event is fired, after which it is removed.|
|emitter.removeListener(event, listener); |Remove a listener from the listener array for the specified event.|
|emitter.removeAllListeners([event]);     |Removes all listeners, or those of the specified event.|
|emitter.setMaxListeners(n);              |By default EventEmitters will print a warning if more than 10 listeners are added for a particular event.|
|emitter.listeners(event);                   |Returns an array of listeners for the specified event.|
|emitter.emit(event, [arg1], [arg2], [...]); |Execute each of the listeners in order with the supplied arguments. Returns true if event had listeners, false otherwise.|
|EventEmitter.listenerCount(emitter, event);  |Return the number of listeners for a given event.|

## Stream

A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in Node. For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is stdout. Streams are readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of EventEmitter.

The Readable stream interface is the abstraction for a source of data that you are reading from.
In other words, data comes out of a Readable stream.
A Readable stream will not start emitting data until you indicate that you are ready to receive it.
Examples of readable streams include: http responses on the client, http requests on the server, fs read streams
zlib streams, crypto streams, tcp sockets, child process stdout and stderr, process.stdin.

```javascript
var readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
```

|  API                                  |  Description                         |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|readable.on('readable', function() {});  |When a chunk of data can be read from the stream, it will emit a 'readable' event|
|readable.on('data', function(chunk) {}); |If you attach a data event listener, then it will switch the stream into flowing mode, and data will be passed to your handler as soon as it is available.|
|readable.on('end', function() {});       |This event fires when there will be no more data to read.|
|readable.on('close', function() {});     |Emitted when the underlying resource (for example, the backing file descriptor) has been closed. Not all streams will emit this.|
|readable.on('error', function() {});     |Emitted if there was an error receiving data.|
|readable.setEncoding(encoding);          |Call this function to cause the stream to return strings of the specified encoding instead of Buffer objects.|
|readable.resume();                       |This method will cause the readable stream to resume emitting data events.|
|readable.pause();                        |This method will cause a stream in flowing-mode to stop emitting data events.|
|readable.pipe(destination, [options]);   |This method pulls all the data out of a readable stream, and writes it to the supplied destination, automatically managing the flow so that the destination is not overwhelmed by a fast readable stream|
|readable.unpipe([destination]);          |This method will remove the hooks set up for a previous pipe() call. If the destination is not specified, then all pipes are removed.|
|readable.unshift(chunk);                  |This is useful in certain cases where a stream is being consumed by a parser, which needs to "un-consume" some data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the stream can be passed on to some other party.|

The Writable stream interface is an abstraction for a destination that you are writing data to.
Examples of writable streams include: http requests on the client, http responses on the server, fs write streams,
zlib streams, crypto streams, tcp sockets, child process stdin, process.stdout, process.stderr.

```javascript
var writer = getWritableStreamSomehow();
```

|  API                                           |  Description                         |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|writable.write(chunk, [encoding], [callback]);  | This method writes some data to the underlying system, and calls the supplied callback once the data has been fully handled.|
|writer.once('drain', write);                    |If a writable.write(chunk) call returns false, then the drain event will indicate when it is appropriate to begin writing more data to the stream.|
|writable.end([chunk], [encoding], [callback]);  |Call this method when no more data will be written to the stream.|
|writer.on('finish', function() {});             |When the end() method has been called, and all data has been flushed to the underlying system, this event is emitted.|
|writer.on('pipe', function(src) {});            |This is emitted whenever the pipe() method is called on a readable stream, adding this writable to its set of destinations.|
|writer.on('unpipe', function(src) {});          |This is emitted whenever the unpipe() method is called on a readable stream, removing this writable from its set of destinations.|
|writer.on('error', function(src) {});            |Emitted if there was an error when writing or piping data.|


Duplex streams are streams that implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces. See above for usage.
Examples of Duplex streams include: tcp sockets, zlib streams, crypto streams.

Transform streams are Duplex streams where the output is in some way computed from the input. They implement both the Readable and Writable interfaces. See above for usage.

Examples of Transform streams include: zlib streams, crypto streams.

## File System

|fs.watch(filename, [options], [listener]);           | Watch for changes on filename, where filename is either a file or a directory. The returned object is a fs.FSWatcher. The listener callback gets two arguments (event, filename). event is either 'rename' or 'change', and filename is the name of the file which triggered the event.|
|fs.exists(path, callback);  | Test whether or not the given path exists by checking with the file system. Then call the callback argument with either true or false. (should not be used)|
|fs.existsSync(path);  |Synchronous version of fs.exists. (should not be used)|
|fs.Stats: |objects returned from fs.stat(), fs.lstat() and fs.fstat() and their synchronous counterparts are of this type.|
|stats.isFile();|  |
|stats.isDirectory()|  |
|stats.isBlockDevice()|  |
|stats.isCharacterDevice()|  |
|stats.isSymbolicLink()  |(only valid with fs.lstat())|
|stats.isFIFO()|  |
|stats.isSocket()|  |

```javascript
fs.createReadStream(path, [options]);   // Returns a new ReadStream object.
